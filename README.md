This website is created using ReactJS showcasing my skills I'm still working on it. In future I will be adding About and Services sections also.

## Getting Started
- clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/VivekSite/portfolio.git`.
- Install the dependencies `npm i`.
- Run the development server `npm start`

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages using gh-pages library.
